# Design Patterns in Java
## Gang of Four
### Creational Design Patterns
<dl>
  <dt>Abstract Factory</dt><dd>Allows for the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.</dd>
  <dt>Builder</dt><dd>Used to create complex objects.</dd>
  <dt>Factory Method</dt><dd>Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.</dd>
  <dt>Prototype</dt><dd>Creates a new object from an existing object.</dd>
  <dt>Singleton</dt><dd>Ensures only one instance of an object is created.</dd>
</dl>

### Structural Design Patterns
<dl>
<dt>Adapter</dt><dd>Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.</dd>
<dt>Bridge</dt><dd>Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.</dd>
<dt>Composite</dt><dd>Takes a group of objects into a single object.</dd>
<dt>Decorator</dt><dd>Allows for an objectâ€™s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.</dd>
<dt>Facade</dt><dd>Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.</dd>
<dt>Flyweight</dt><dd>Reduces the cost of complex object models.</dd>
<dt>Proxy</dt><dd>Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.</dd>
</dl>

### Behavior Design Patterns
<dl>
<dt>Chain of Responsibility</dt><dd>Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.</dd>
<dt>Command</dt><dd>Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.</dd>
<dt>Interpreter</dt><dd>Implements a specialized language.</dd>
<dt>Iterator</dt><dd>Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.</dd>
<dt>Mediator</dt><dd>Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.</dd>
<dt>Memento</dt><dd>Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.</dd>
<dt>Observer</dt><dd>Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.</dd>
<dt>State</dt><dd>Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.</dd>
<dt>Strategy</dt><dd>Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
<dt>Template Method</dt><dd>Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.</dd>
<dt>Visitor</dt><dd>Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.</dd>
</dl>
